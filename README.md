# Faith Sourced Website

The Faith Sourced website is built with React, staticly generated by Gatsby and served on Netlify.

To run a local copy of our site, for your own hacking pleasure, youâ€™ll need some familiarity with the command line, install the requirements and follow these terminal commands.

## Requirements

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Recommended version: LTS)
  * It installs `npm` with it
  * If you want to use different versions of Node you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to switch between them
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

```zh
git clone https://github.com/faithsourced/faithsourced-website.git
cd faithsourced-website
npm install
# You will then be able to open the site on http://localhost:8000
npm start
```
## Updating

```zh
cd faithsourced-website
git pull
```

After pulling from this repo you will want to ensure that any new dependencies are installed :

```zh
cd faithsourced-website
npm update
```

## To-Do List
* form field validation (currently Netlify does all the backend sanitization and validation but it would be good to have some frontend validation as well)
* lazy load article banner images (they don't need to be part of the initial load)
* update blurred background image when you jump to different site sections (with lazy load to minimize initial bandwidth requirments)
* blog posting (in progress)
* stripe checkout for Faith Sourced sticker pack promotion (in progress)
